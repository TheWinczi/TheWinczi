- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheWinczi on GitHub, and my name is Maciej Winczewski.
- 👀 I’m interested in science, especially math and physics, which I integrate into the broad field of IT.
- 🖥️ I love programming in Python 🐍, but my studies introduced me to the fun and efficient world of C/C++.
- 🤖 My interests and studies have given me a solid foundation in Artificial Intelligence, which I find fascinating.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me! You can contact me via:
